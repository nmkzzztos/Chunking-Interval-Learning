# Backend

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Python 3.8 or higher is recommended. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If `pip` isnâ€™t already installed, then first try to bootstrap it from the standard library:
```sh
py -m ensurepip --default-pip
```

### Environment Setup
To set up a virtual environment, follow these steps:

Create vurtial environment
```sh
python -m venv env
```
    
Activate virtual evironment
```sh
venv/scripts/activate
```

### Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is active, you can install the required dependencies. The backend relies on Flask, Flask-Cors for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM, and several other packages for various functionalities.
